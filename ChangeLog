iRedAPD-2.1:
    * Improvements:
        + plugins/greylisting.py: if client passed greylisting service, remove
          other tracking records from same IP immediately to keep database
          small.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Not strip address extension in sender/recipient mail address.
        - plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py:
            - should not consider backup mx domain name as local domain.
              Thanks Znekar <znekar _at_ znekar.com> for the report in forum.
            - [ldap] not check domain status while getting account ldif data.
              Thanks Ben Lin <ben_lin _at_ opl.com.tw> for the report.

iRedAPD-2.0:
    * New plugins:
        - plugins/whitelist_outbound_recipient.py: used to automatically
          whitelist outbound recipient for greylisting (parameter
          'WL_RCPT_FOR_GREYLISTING'). Please check comment lines in
          `libs/default_settings.py` for more details.

    * Improvements:
        - Copy `plugins/custom_*` during upgrading to keep custom plugins.
        - Able to throttle based on external senders.
        - Handle systemd script while upgrading in tools/upgrade_iredapd.sh.
        - Return 'DISCARD' instead of 'REJECT' to Postfix so that blacklisted
          sender won't know it's blacklisted.
        - If one sender passed greylisting service, we reuse the sender IP
          address to avoid further temporary rejection.
        - Get full traceback if error occurs while applying plugin.
        - Reduce SQLAlchemy connection pool recycle to 360 (was 3600) to work
          better on low traffic server.
        - SQLAlchemy connection pool size and pool recycle are configurable
          with parameter `SQL_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE` and
          `SQL_CONNECTION_POOL_RECYCLE` in iRedAPD config file.
        - tools/greylisting_admin.py::
            + able to specify IP address/network, email address as sender.
            + able to add/list per-account whitelists.
        - Add systemd script used to control iredapd service:
          rc_scripts/iredapd.service.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Memory leak due to not clean up session tracking data.
        - plugins/throttle.py: Throttle plugin cannot handle email which has
          multiple recipients.
          Thanks to Andrea <info _at_ nili.ca> for the report.
        - plugins/amavisd_wblist.py: not apply inbound wblist if both sender
          and recipient are local virtual mail user.
          Thanks Tom <tom _at_ ansspc.com> for the report in forum.
        - plugins/sql_alias_access_policy: if access policy is 'subdomain',
          email sent from alias member (which is under same domain) to
          <alias_account@alias_domain.com> was incorrectly rejected.
        - Incorrect account type: tld_domain -> top_level_domain.
          Thanks Ralph <shane _at_ greenjames.com> for the report in forum.
        - Remove host bits in IP address of SPF record in
          tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: x.x.x.Y/zz -> x.x.x.Y.
        - White/blacklist doesn't work if email was sent from SOGo or
          ActiveSync client (e.g. Outlook).
          Thanks <alexeilevinzon _at gmail.com> for the report.
        - tools/wblist_admin.py cannot add/delete white/blacklists.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: inserts whitelists without
          checking whether it exists, this causes annoying warning message in
          PostgreSQL log file due to duplicate key.

iRedAPD-1.9.1:
    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly handle nested 'include:' tag in
          tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py (bug introduced in v1.9.0).

iRedAPD-1.9.0:
    * Improvements:
        + plugins/throttle.py: log period and time left before tracking record
          expires.
        + plugins/greylisting.py: log more info when log level is 'info'.

        + tools/greylisting_admin.py: it's now able to
            * list all whitelisted senders (--list-whitelists)
            * list all sender domains (--list-whitelist-domains)
            * whitelist a sender domain (--whitelist-domain)
            * remove a whitelisted domain (--remove-whitelist-domain)
            * delete tracking data after whitelisted a sender domain

        + tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py:
            * store whitelist sender domain in sql db (--submit)

        + tools/cleanup_db.py: remove old action logs which are stored in
          iredadmin database. Defaults to keep for 7 days.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Incorrect function call to execute SQL command in file
          tools/migrate_cluebringer_greylisting.py.
          Thanks Ivan Novokhatski <de7 _at_ deseven.info> for the report.
        - Infinite loop caused by improper SPF record which contains itself.
        - Improper type of sql columns: throttle.{msg_size,max_quota,max_msgs}.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: not combine splited IP
          address in returned SPF record. For example, it may return value
          like "[..., '192.168.1', '0.20', ...]", but it should be
          "[..., '192.168.10.20', ...]".
        - plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: not correctly handle email
          sent by external user.

iRedAPD-1.8.0:
    * New SQL table "greylisting_whitelist_domains", used to store mail domain
      names which you want to disable greylisting for their mail servers.

      Note: these domain names are not used by iRedAPD plugin `greylisting`
            directly, you need to setup a daily cron job to run script
            'tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py' to whitelist IP addresses
            and networks of their mail servers.

    * New script:
        - tools/greylisting_admin.py: used to manage greylisting settings.
        - tools/wblist_admin.py: used to manage inbound/outbound whitelists
          and blacklists.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: it queries SPF DNS records of
          given domains and imports converted IP addresses/networks as
          greylisting whitelists.

          if no domain name specified, it queries from NEW sql table
          "iredapd.greylisting_whitelist_domains".

          if no SPF record for specified domain name, MX records will be used.

    * Fixed issues:
        - plugins/throttle.py:
            * Cannot apply throttle setting correctly if `max_quota` is set to
              unlimited.
              Thanks Tu Ngoc Tan <tantn3 _at_ fpt.com.vn> for the report.
        - plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py:
            * not bypass email which is not sent by authenticated user.
              Note: it won't cause incorrect email rejection.
            * raise error if we have both ALLOWED_LOGIN_MISMATCH_STRICTLY and
              ALLOWED_LOGIN_MISMATCH_LIST_MEMBER enabled.
              Thanks rk <rk _at_ redb.cz> for the report in forum.
        - plugins/amavisd_wblist.py:
            * fix improper high priority, it should be run after other plugins.
            * incorrect priority for outbound wblist.
              Thanks bigman <jenri.tan _at_ gmail> fot the report in forum.
            * not bypass email which doesn't contain a sender or sasl_username
              address. Note: it won't cause incorrect mail rejection.
        - Not correctly update log file path in tools/upgrade_iredapd.sh.
        - Not enable greylisting by default.

iRedAPD-1.7.0:
    * New plugins:
        + plugins/greylisting.py.
        + plugins/throttle.py. used to throttle inbound/outbound emails based
          on amount of mails, total mail size sent over a given period of time,
          or size of single message.

          - New script tools/cleanup_db.py, used to clean up expired throttle
            tracking records, it's supposed to be run every hour as a cron job.
          - New script tools/migrate_cluebringer_throttle.py, used to migrate
            Cluebringer throttle settings.
          - New script tools/migrate_cluebringer_greylisting.py, used to
            migrate Cluebringer greylisting settings, including whitelists.

    * Removed plugins:
        - plugins/ldap_amavisd_block_blacklisted_senders.py
        - plugins/ldap_recipient_restrictions.py
        - plugins/sql_user_restrictions.py
        - plugins/amavisd_message_size_limit.py

      First 3 plugins are replaced by 'plugins/amavisd_wblist.py', last one
      is replaced by new plugin 'plugins/throttle.py'.

    * Improvements:
        - Auto rotate log files (under /var/log/iredapd/). Supports rotating
          based on file size or time interval (e.g. everyday, every week,
          every 3 midnight), rotated log file will be compressed with zip.
          Default is rotating every Sunday, keeping 12 copies (3 months).
        - Allow to use IP network in MYNETWORKS. e.g. 192.168.0.0/24.

              address under the same domain.
            + able to not check forged sender which sent without smtp auth, or
              bypass specified forged sender addresses.

        - plugins/amavisd_wblist.py:
            + Able to check white/blacklist for outbound message.
              Note: new SQL table `amavisd.outbound_wblist` is required.
            + Able to not check white/blacklists on outgoing emails sent by
              authenticated user. Default is not bypassed.
              Note: Controlled by new setting: `WBLIST_BYPASS_OUTGOING_EMAIL`,
              default value is False (not bypassed).

        - plugins/{sql,ldap}_force_change_password_in_days.py:
            + Allow specified users or domains to never change password.

    * Fixed issues:

          get_applicable_policy().
          Thanks <kmihalj _at_ efzg.hr> for the report in forum.

iRedAPD-1.6.0:
    * New setting: `MYNETWORKS`. used to set trusted or internal networks.
    * Plugin `ldap_domain_wblist` was removed, we didn't use it at all.
    * Plugin `ldap_recipient_restrictions` is marked as deprecated, please use
      `amavisd_wblist` instead.

    * Fixed issues:
        * plugins/ldap_maillist_access_policy.py: not use correct ldap
          connection cursor. this causes access policy not work.
        * plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: Not return correct value for
          allowed senders.
        * Not correctly fetch SQL query result with SQLAlchemy.
