    Python 2 support, please try the latest iRedAPD-3.x release:
    https://github.com/iredmail/iRedAPD/releases

    - Drop Python-2 support and completely switch to Python-3.
    - Fixed issues:
        - tools/wblist_admin.py: Can not delete all whitelists or blacklists.

iRedAPD-3.6:
    - Improvements:
        + plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: able to verify whether
          sender is a member of subscribeable (mlmmj) mailing list.

    - Fixed issues:
        - plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: bypass if sender is sending
          as null sender with smtp auth. Leave it to plugin
          `reject_null_sender`.
        - plugins/throttle.py: not treat email from localhost (127.0.0.1 or
          ::1) but no SMTP authentication as outbound.

iRedAPD-3.5:
    - Fixed issues:
        - plugins/greylisting.py: if recipient domain is an alias domain, it

iRedAPD-3.4:

    NOTE: This is the last release which supports Python-2.

    - Improvements:
        - Support '--foreground' argument to run in foreground.
          Useful for running inside docker container.
        - tools/senderscore_admin.py: command line script used to manage
          senderscore plugin. Currently only whitelisting IP addresses is
          supported.
        - tools/cleanup_db.py: instead of deleting all matched records in one
          command, it now deletes limited records (defaults to 1000) each time.
          If some SQL table has a lot records, deleting all in one command may
          take a long time and causes deadlock/conflict, SQL server may abort
          the transaction.

    - Fixed issues:
        - plugins/throttle.py: Stored initial message size was wrong.
        - tools/upgrade_iredapd.sh:

          If set to `True`, iRedAPD will discard email instead of rejecting
          it with message `Blacklisted`.

          Defaults to `False`.

    - Fixed issues:
        - Do not enable SRS automatically after upgrade.
        - Not avoid duplicate logging of smtp sessions.
        - plugins/senderscore.py: not cache score if DNS query failed.

iRedAPD-3.2:
    - New plugin: senderscore.

        It queries sender server IP address against `senderscore.com` by DNS,
        if the returned reputation score equals to or is lower than defined
        reject score (defaults to 30), email will be rejected.

        NOTE: This plugin is NOT enabled by default.

    + Improvements:
        + Log encryption cipher and server port number used by client.
        + Able to log the smtp sessions processed by iRedAPD in SQL database.
          Log will expire in 7 days by default.

          Note: logging is enabled by default, could be disabled with
          setting `LOG_SMTP_SESSIONS = False`.

iRedAPD-3.1:
    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly set timeout of DNS query.
        - Default timeout of DNS query was too long (20 seconds), if the query
          took long time to get an answer, Postfix may reject emails and
          raise error:
          `warning: connect to 127.0.0.1:7777: Connection timed out`.
        - Plugin `greylisting` doesn't work if sender address is empty.

iRedAPD-3.0:
    * Fixed issues:
        - Not allow '&' in username part of email address.
        - Not include all possible sender addresses while applying greylisting
          setting.
        - Throttling doesn't work.

iRedAPD-2.9:
    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly update throttle tracking data in some case.
        - It considers trusted clients as internal senders which is not right.

iRedAPD-2.8:
    * Improvements:
        + Bypass greylisting service if sender server IP address is listed
          in SPF DNS record of sender domain.

          It's enabled by default, and can be disabled with setting
          `GREYLISTING_BYPASS_SPF = False`.

          Thanks to "Brno University of Technology Computer and Information
          Services Centre" (www.vut.cz) for sponsoring this development.

    * Fixed issues:

iRedAPD-2.5:
    * New feature:
        + SRS (Sender Rewrite Scheme) support.

    * Improvements:
        + plugins/greylisting.py: slight performance improvement while
          checking whitelists:
            - don't query unused SQL columns
            - reduce matched IPv6 CIDR networks

    * Fixed issues:
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: not treat x.x.x.Y/x as a valid
          IPv4 CIDR range (Y != 0).
          Thanks Tomaž Brišnik for the report.

iRedAPD-2.4:
    * Fixed issues:
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: not correctly return valid IP
          address.
          Thanks Kacper Guzik <kacper.guzik _at_ zenbox _dot_ pl> for the report.

iRedAPD-2.3:
    * Improvements:
        + plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py:
            + Able to bypass wildcard address 'user@*'.
            + Set `CHECK_SPF_IF_LOGIN_MISMATCH = True` by default. If sender
              address is considerred as forged, check DNS SPF record of sender
              domain and bypass if client is listed in SPF record.
        + plugins/throttle.py:
            + Send notification email to admins when someone exceeded quota.
            + New parameter THROTTLE_BYPASS_SAME_DOMAIN: if set to True,
              do not apply recipient throttling if both sender and recipient
              are in same domain. Defaults to True.
            + New parameter THROTTLE_BYPASS_LOCAL_RECIPIENT: if set to True,
              do not apply recipient throttling if both sender and recipient
              are hosted locally. Defaults to True.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Doesn't recognize IP address like 'xx.xx.xx.xx/yy' while querying
          SPF DNS record.
        - plugin/throttle.py: explict unlimited setting doesn't work.
        - Not use 'utf8' as default SQL charset.
        - Do not exit iRedAPD service if ldap service is not reachable.
        - systemd service cannot start if iRedAPD needs to access some local or
          remote mount point while starting.
        - Plugin 'ldap_maillist_access_policy'
            - It treats member as moderator.

        + plugins/ldap_maillist_access_policy.py: supports access policy of
          mlmmj mailing list.
        + plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: If login mismatch (From: vs
          SASL username), bypass sender if sender server is listed in DNS SPF
          record.

          This is disabled by default, set `CHECK_SPF_IF_LOGIN_MISMATCH = True`
          in iRedAPD config file and restart iredapd service to enable it.

          Sponsored development by Kacper Guzik <kacper.guzik _at_ zenbox.pl>.

        + Log client hostname, reverse hostname, helo hostname.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Not verify ip address/network specified in DNS SPF record with
          ip4/+ip4/ip6/+ip6 tag.
        - tools/upgrade_iredapd.sh: syntax error while creating 'wblist_rdns'
          SQL table with PostgreSQL command line.
          Thanks Nameless <nonsenseisay _at_ protonmail.com> for the report in
          forum.
        - plugins/ldap_maillist_access_policy.py: didn't handle deprecated
          policy name 'allowedonly'. it's still used by old iRedMail.
        - plugins/throttle.py: didn't apply throttle setting if recipient is an
          alias domain.
        - plugins/amavisd_wblist.py: didn't apply wblist if recipient is an
          alias domain.
          Thanks tom cotton <tom _at_ ansspc.com> for the report in forum.
        - Not escape dangerous characters in SQL queries.
        - iRedAPD was not ran as 'iredapd' group.
        - Don't return disabled domain as a local domain.
        - If client is sending email from trusted networks without SMTP AUTH,
          it's not considered as an internal sender and no outbound throttling
          applied.
          Thanks Ahmad M. Al-Masry <Ahmad.AlMasry _at_ iah.ps> for the report.

iRedAPD-2.1:
    * New plugins:
        + plugins/wblist_rdns.py: whitelisting and blacklisting based on
          reverse DNS name of sender server IP address.

          192.168.1.0/24, 2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64.
          Sponsored development by Daniel Senie <dts _at_ amaranth.com>.
        + plugins/greylisting.py:
            - if client passes, remove other tracking records from same IP
              immediately to keep database small.
            - if sender server already passed, renews the expire time when a
              new email from same sender server.
              Thanks Ian Knight <ian _at_ 34sp _dot_ com> for the code
              contrubtion.

            - not check per-user alias addresses.
              Thanks Wraptor <nijs.thibaut _at_ gmail> for the report in forum.
            - should not consider backup mx domain name as local domain.
              Thanks Znekar <znekar _at_ znekar.com> for the report in forum.
            - [ldap] not check domain status while getting account ldif data.
              Thanks Ben Lin <ben_lin _at_ opl.com.tw> for the report.

iRedAPD-2.0:
    * New plugins:
        - plugins/whitelist_outbound_recipient.py: used to automatically
          whitelist outbound recipient for greylisting (parameter
          'WL_RCPT_FOR_GREYLISTING'). Please check comment lines in
          `libs/default_settings.py` for more details.

    * Improvements:
        - Copy `plugins/custom_*` during upgrading to keep custom plugins.
        - Able to throttle based on external senders.
        - Handle systemd script while upgrading in tools/upgrade_iredapd.sh.
        - Return 'DISCARD' instead of 'REJECT' to Postfix so that blacklisted
          sender won't know it's blacklisted.
        - If one sender passed greylisting service, we reuse the sender IP
          address to avoid further temporary rejection.
        - Get full traceback if error occurs while applying plugin.
        - Reduce SQLAlchemy connection pool recycle to 360 (was 3600) to work
          better on low traffic server.
        - SQLAlchemy connection pool size and pool recycle are configurable
          with parameter `SQL_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE` and
          `SQL_CONNECTION_POOL_RECYCLE` in iRedAPD config file.
        - tools/greylisting_admin.py::
            + able to specify IP address/network, email address as sender.
            + able to add/list per-account whitelists.
        - Add systemd script used to control iredapd service:
          rc_scripts/iredapd.service.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Memory leak due to not clean up session tracking data.
        - plugins/throttle.py: Throttle plugin cannot handle email which has
          multiple recipients.
          Thanks to Andrea <info _at_ nili.ca> for the report.
        - plugins/amavisd_wblist.py: not apply inbound wblist if both sender
          and recipient are local virtual mail user.
          Thanks Tom <tom _at_ ansspc.com> for the report in forum.
        - plugins/sql_alias_access_policy: if access policy is 'subdomain',
          email sent from alias member (which is under same domain) to
          <alias_account@alias_domain.com> was incorrectly rejected.
        - Incorrect account type: tld_domain -> top_level_domain.
          Thanks Ralph <shane _at_ greenjames.com> for the report in forum.
        - Remove host bits in IP address of SPF record in
          tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: x.x.x.Y/zz -> x.x.x.Y.
        - White/blacklist doesn't work if email was sent from SOGo or
          ActiveSync client (e.g. Outlook).
          Thanks <alexeilevinzon _at gmail.com> for the report.
        - tools/wblist_admin.py cannot add/delete white/blacklists.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: inserts whitelists without
          checking whether it exists, this causes annoying warning message in
          PostgreSQL log file due to duplicate key.

iRedAPD-1.9.1:
    * Fixed issues:
        - Not correctly handle nested 'include:' tag in
          tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py (bug introduced in v1.9.0).

iRedAPD-1.9.0:
    * Improvements:
        + plugins/throttle.py: log period and time left before tracking record
          expires.
        + plugins/greylisting.py: log more info when log level is 'info'.

        + tools/greylisting_admin.py: it's now able to
            * list all whitelisted senders (--list-whitelists)
            * list all sender domains (--list-whitelist-domains)
            * whitelist a sender domain (--whitelist-domain)
            * remove a whitelisted domain (--remove-whitelist-domain)
            * delete tracking data after whitelisted a sender domain

        + tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py:
            * store whitelist sender domain in sql db (--submit)

        + tools/cleanup_db.py: remove old action logs which are stored in
          iredadmin database. Defaults to keep for 7 days.

    * Fixed issues:
        - Incorrect function call to execute SQL command in file
          tools/migrate_cluebringer_greylisting.py.
          Thanks Ivan Novokhatski <de7 _at_ deseven.info> for the report.
        - Infinite loop caused by improper SPF record which contains itself.
        - Improper type of sql columns: throttle.{msg_size,max_quota,max_msgs}.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: not combine splited IP
          address in returned SPF record. For example, it may return value
          like "[..., '192.168.1', '0.20', ...]", but it should be
          "[..., '192.168.10.20', ...]".
        - plugins/reject_sender_login_mismatch.py: not correctly handle email
          sent by external user.

iRedAPD-1.8.0:
    * New SQL table "greylisting_whitelist_domains", used to store mail domain
      names which you want to disable greylisting for their mail servers.

      Note: these domain names are not used by iRedAPD plugin `greylisting`
            directly, you need to setup a daily cron job to run script
            'tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py' to whitelist IP addresses
            and networks of their mail servers.

    * New script:
        - tools/greylisting_admin.py: used to manage greylisting settings.
        - tools/wblist_admin.py: used to manage inbound/outbound whitelists
          and blacklists.
        - tools/spf_to_greylist_whitelists.py: it queries SPF DNS records of
          given domains and imports converted IP addresses/networks as
          greylisting whitelists.

          if no domain name specified, it queries from NEW sql table
          "iredapd.greylisting_whitelist_domains".

          if no SPF record for specified domain name, MX records will be used.
